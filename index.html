            <h2>Out come and achievements</h2>
            <p>Considering how rapidly the medical cannabis market 
                segment is evolving, Cancare required a fast turn around. 
                The app got to the market in just three months, and 
                it was already winning over most competitors thanks to 
                its usability and reliability. After a quick marketing 
                campaign, the founders have been able to generate revenues 
                from day one.
